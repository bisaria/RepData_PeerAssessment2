Analysis of NOAA Storm Database

Environmental events, like tornados and tsunamis, having sufficient intensity, can have devastating effect on the affected area, causing loss of life, injuries, massive structural damage, disruption to commerce and more.

Storm Data is an official publication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in United State, which documents the occurrence of 48 significant weather events having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Weather service (NWS) receives these information from a variety of sources and then uses several algorithms to prepare the Storm Data product into the integrated database. 

For this study, Storm Data compiled over the year 1950 to 2011 will be used. We will be looking at the each event and the damages it caused to people and property. Such a report may be read by a government or municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events.

Objective of this assignment is to address the following questions:

      1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the `EVTYPE` variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
  
      2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
